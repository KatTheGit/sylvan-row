A bunny combat medic who seems to enjoy
the "combat" part a bit too much.

PRIMARY - Kindness in Blood
  Raphaelle is always tethered to allies nearby.
  She shoots a piercing projectile, and if it
  damages an opponent, her tethered allies
  recieve health.
  When empowered by DASH, her projectile doesn't
  heal allies, does more damage, and reduces the
  cooldown of DASH.

SECONDARY - Sanctum
  Places down a tree, healing nearby allies and
  increasing their fire rate.

DASH - Enpowering Leap
  A short dash that empowers the next PRIMARY.

PASSIVE - Flight
  Gains a small speed buff when she gets hit.
