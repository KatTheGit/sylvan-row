A strong pious deer with the noble mission of
protecting those who can't defend themselves.

PRIMARY - Buck-Shot

  shield reduces secondary charge.
  If this ability is active, PASSIVE stops.

DASH - Intervene
  A long dash. If empowered, heals allies
  and damages opponents in his path.

PASSIVE - Inspire
  Makes nearby allies faster.
