A strong pious deer with the noble mission of
protecting those who can't defend themselves.

PRIMARY - Buck-Shot
  A shotgun with a tight spread that does more
  damage up close. Hurting an opponent empowers
  his DASH.

SECONDARY - Guardian Angel
  Holds a large shield in front of himself, as
  long as he has charge. Taking damage with the
  shield consumes charge.
  If this ability is active, PASSIVE no longer
  applies.

DASH - Intervene
  A long dash. If empowered, allies he passed
  through are healed, and opponents are damaged.

PASSIVE - Inspire
  Provides a small movement buff to nearby
  allies and himself.
