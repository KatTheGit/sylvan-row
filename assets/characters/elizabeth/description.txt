PRIMARY - Cunning Knives
  Throws a knife that can bounce off walls. At
  the end of its trajectory, the knife stays
  on the ground. Only two knives can be on the
  ground at one.
SECONDARY - Thingymajig
  Creates a walking turret that moves in a
  direction and pinballs around while shooting
  any nearby opponents.
DASH - Recall
  Dashes and makes all grounded knives return
  to him. The knives damage opponents in their
  path. Opponents caught by multiple knives
  are marginally slowed.
