## Character balance rules
Goal: balance logically/mathematically, and organically later only if needed
- All characters of the same class must take the exact same amount of time to take down a full-health same-class character when continuously shooting.
- Secondaries are never direct attacks, and usually will not combo (directly) with the primary attack.
- Healers can heal 0-100% at half the kill speed of all other characters.
- Only healers can have offensive secondaries, charged by healing teammates or passively.

Of course all of this will be kept or trashed depending on playtester opinions.
